# Final Exam

## Q3 paper strength analysis

``` {R}
data = read.csv("./strength.dat", header=T, sep="\t")
head(data)
X = data[, c("X1", "X2", "X3", "X4")]
Y = data[, c("Y1", "Y2", "Y3", "Y4")]
```

### (a) Canonical analysis
``` {R}
library(CCA)
result <-cc(X, Y)
barplot(result$cor)
# plt.cc(result)
"Correlation"
result$cor
"X loadings"
result$xcoef
"Y loadings"
result$ycoef
```

We can find first two axis are good enough(have higher correlations).

### (b) Explain first variates of cca

Try to rotate the axis by first loadings.
``` {R}
nx = as.matrix(X) %*% result$xcoef[, 1]
ny = as.matrix(Y) %*% result$ycoef[, 1]
n = data.frame(nx, ny)
```

Then, simply feed in to linear regression.

``` {R}
fit = lm(ny ~ nx, n)
summary(fit)
plot(nx, ny)
abline(fit)
```

Where it's $R^2$ is 0.8389, both p values of the slope and intercept are close to 0, so I think is a good measurment.

or you can evalute by testing
``` {R}
n = nrow(data)
dimx = ncol(X)
dimy = ncol(Y)
# Bartlett's test
test =  -( n - 0.5 * (dimx + dimy + 3) ) * log(1 - result$cor[1])
"P value"
test_p = pchisq(test, df=dimx + dimy - 1 + 1, lower.tail=FALSE)
test_p
```

Which get the same result as above that p value is close to 0.
