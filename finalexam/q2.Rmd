## Q2 Grade data Analysis
``` {R}
data = read.csv("./GRADES.dat", header=T, sep="")
head(data)
d = dist(data)
```

### (a)(b) Clustering and find the minial

Using hclust to cluster to two groups by each method.
``` {R}
method = c("ward.D", "ward.D2", "single", "complete", "average", "median", "mcquitty", "centroid")

for (i in 1:length(method)) {
    dc = hclust(d, method=method[i])
    memb = cutree(dc, k = 2)
    d1 = colMeans(data[memb == 1,])
    d2 = colMeans(data[memb == 2,])
    dd = t(data.frame(d1, d2))
    dd = data.frame(dd, len=c(sum(memb == 1), sum(memb == 2)))
    print(method[i])
    print(dd)
}
```

The result show that `ward.D` and `mcquitty` make the minial students to fail by the distance of those 6 dimensions. It only fail 13 students.

Or you use `single` to cut, only 1 students will fail, however his/her lab and homework is somewhat better than another groups.
